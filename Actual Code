To do for Dylan

# Watch pygame tutorial by freecode camp on youtube, watch the part on how to add back ground images and understand it.
# Prob need to watch the first 10 min to understand the for loops in the program

# Create the "Gifs" rememeber, seperate images per level, like 3 will be fine to loop thorugh then to give a gif effect.



# Optional below, Lmk if you decide to do it or not:

# Look up how to add gif in pygame on youtube, watch the 5 min video
# It'll tell you how to do it on a sprite, somehow if possible, implement that into the background instead of the sprite
